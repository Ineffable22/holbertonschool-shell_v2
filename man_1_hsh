.SH NAME
    hsh - create a Shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
    hsh [FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Shell_v2 repository contains files from my version of Shell, but a second version more advanced to Simple_shell, which is a UNIX shell based on bash and Sh. This is my command line version of the interpreter it is written in C language.

This shell starts reading .hshrc and then optionally reads the first argument represented by a file and executes all internal commands. Then it prints a prompt and starts reading the commands. And what's more, it creates a history per command inserted.
